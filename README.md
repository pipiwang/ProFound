# ProFound: Vision Foundation Models for Prostate Multiparametric MR Images
ProFound is a suite of vision foundation models, pre-trained on multiparametric 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images from large collections of prostate cancer patients. 

We aim to open-source all code for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, together with weights of pre-trained and fine-tuned ProFound models. This is an ongoing effort, so please check back later for updates.


## üê£ Downstream Clinical Tasks
Profound can be fine-tuned for a wide range of prostate imaging tasks. Switch to the `demo` branch for examples:
```batch
git checkout demo
```

- Download weights and example images [here](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rmapyw0_ucl_ac_uk/ElyR-Bc7QqVAjhShIptm9K8BJsSb6QKKqJn0XolSEj0vgQ?e=MsrMCf).
- Save them to the repository root directory and run the following tasks.

### Radiological cancer classification
- **Run**:
  ```bash
  sh demo_run_classification.sh
  ```
<!-- - **Example output:**  
  ![Cancer segmentation example](./assets/cancer_segmentation_example.png) -->

### Lesion segmentation
- **Run**:
  ```bash
  sh demo_run_segmentation.sh
  ```
<!-- - **Example output:**  
  ![Gland segmentation example](./assets/anatomy_segmentation_example.png) -->

<!-- ### Cancer localisation
- **Download weights**: [fine-tuned weights](https://your-download-link-here.com)
- **Run**:
  ```bash
  python ./demo/localisation_pirads3.py
  ```
- **Example output**:

*More tasks are on the way...*



## ü•ö Pre-trained Models

### Available models
- **ProFound-alpha**: [Download pre-trained weights](https://your-download-link-here.com)
> Pre-trained on approximately 5,000 international, cross-institute, multiparametric prostate MRI studies, each of which includes T2w, ADC and high-b DWI volumes
