# ProFound: Vision Foundation Models for Prostate Multiparametric MR Images
ProFound is a suite of vision foundation models, pre-trained on multiparametric 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images from thousands of prostate cancer patients. 

We aim to open-source all code for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, together with weights of pre-trained and fine-tuned ProFound models. This is an ongoing effort, so please check back later for updates.


## üê£ Downstream Clinical Tasks
Profound can be fine-tuned for a wide range of prostate imaging tasks. Switch to the `demo` branch for examples:
```batch
git checkout demo
```

### Radiological cancer classification
- **Download weights**: [fine-tuned weights](https://your-download-link-here.com)
- **Run**:
  ```bash
  python ./demo/classification_pirads.py
  ```
- **Example output:**  
  ![Cancer segmentation example](./assets/cancer_segmentation_example.png)

### Anatomy segmentation
- **Download weights**: [fine-tuned weights](https://your-download-link-here.com)
- **Run**:
  ```bash
  python ./demo/segmentation_anatomy.py
  ```
- **Example output:**

### Cancer localisation
- **Download weights**: [fine-tuned weights](https://your-download-link-here.com)
- **Run**:
  ```bash
  python ./demo/localisation_pirads3.py
  ```
- **Example output**:
